# Chinese Word Segmentation using a Bi-LSTM
University project on Chinese Word Segmentation using a Bidirectional LSTM

The project consisted in building a Bidirectional LSTM model to segment and label Chinese characters based on their position in a word:
- B beginning
- I inside
- E end
- S single character


The model was developed in Keras and achieved a final precision of 0.93 on the test set.
The project was part of the module in Natural Language Processing where the score.py and the skeleton of the prediction function in predict.py were given and had to be used to assess the overall precision of the model.
